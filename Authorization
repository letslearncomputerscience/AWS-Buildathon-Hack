Integer	The maximum number of minutes allocated for the Authorize operation call to be processed, after which the authorization is automatically declined and you cannot capture funds against the authorization.

Note: In asynchronous mode, the Authorize operation always returns the State as Pending. The authorization remains in this state until it is processed by Amazon. The processing time varies and can be a minute or more. After processing is complete, Amazon notifies you of the final processing status. For more information, see Instant Payment Notification (IPN) in the Amazon Pay and Login with Amazon integration guide.

Allowed values:

true--The specified amount is directly captured. You do not need to call the Capture operation.
